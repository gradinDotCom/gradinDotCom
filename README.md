- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gradinDotCom, sometimes known as 2mOlaf (_the 2 meter Olaf in case you know a lot of Olafs_)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, Azure, Infrastructure as Code, and IoT.
- ðŸŒ± I dabble in a variety of scripting languages and am rusty on PHP. I'm _really_ rusty on ColdFusion!
- ðŸ“« I'm not terribly active on social platforms except Discord, but I'm pretty easy to find!
